    Collabora Office is a powerful LibreOffice-based office suite that supports all major document, spreadsheet, presentation, and drawing file formats. It is an initial version of [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraonline.com/collabora-online/) ported to desktop, sharing the same underlying code.

    Collabora Office allows working with documents locally and collaboration features are [planned](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollaboraOffice/comments/1pg5i04/comment/nswivuy/) in upcoming versions.

    If a multi-user real-time collaboration experience is required, please use **Collabora Online**, instead of the desktop version.

    If syncing to nextcloud without real-time collaboration is enough you can set up the [Nextcloud desktop sync client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/desktop/installation.html), as [recommended by Collabora](https://forum.collaboraonline.com/t/cannot-open-files-in-the-desktop-version-from-mapped-drives/4644/2).
